# Learning Project - Typescript Monorepo / NX / Docker

This learning project primarily focuses on managing a Typescript Monorepo using NX. It also will provide an opportunity to practice using containers for Build/Test tasks that can be leveraged in a CI/CD pipeline.

## Project Description

We will be building a web application for a video rental store company

## Project Goals

* NX is used to manage projects
* Custom NX generators & executors used, or a custom plugin
* Docker image which supports building, running, and testing the application

## Monorepo Projects

* Fastify API Backend
* Employee Web App (Angular)
* Customer Web App (Svelte)

## Feature Ideas

These are just ideas, this project focuses on proper use of nx and docker, but if I need to write some features to better illustrate nx usage here are some features to implement.

* An employee can
  * onboard or shut down a new store location
  * adjust a stores movie inventory
  * create new movies
  * view a customers information

* A User can
  * view their account info
  * purchase any of their current rentals
